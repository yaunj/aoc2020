I'll try my hand at some Go this year. Lets see how many I have the time for. :)

One command per day. Testdata symlinked from each command for convenience.

    # Run tests for one day:
    go test ./cmd/day1
    
    # Run one day directly:
    go run ./cmd/day1
    
    # Build one day:
    go build ./cmd/day1
